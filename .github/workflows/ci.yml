# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel.
jobs:
  # We define a single job called "build-and-test".
  build-and-test:
    # The type of virtual machine to run the job on. We use the latest Ubuntu.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # A job is a sequence of steps.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository's code
      # This downloads your code onto the virtual machine.
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up a Python environment
      # This installs a specific version of Python.
      - name: Set up Python 3.9
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: 3.9

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      # This runs pip install using the full requirements file.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Step 4: Run the tests with pytest
      # This is the most important step. If this command fails, the entire workflow fails.
